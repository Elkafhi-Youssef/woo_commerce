Product Variation Swatches For WooCommerce Products.

== Description ==
Are you getting frustrated with WooCommerce’s current way of presenting the product attributes for your products? Well, This plugin allows you to turn the WooCommerce product variation's select options into more user-friendly swatches. Such as color swatch, button swatch & image swatch. That means you no longer need to rely on the default dropdown options when it comes to selecting product variations. With the help of this plugin, the customers will have the opportunity to observe the products they need more visually than the default dropdown options shown in WooCommerce.

This exceptional WordPress plugin is designed for all store owners that want their customers to find what they’re searching for quickly. Get rid of dropdown type determination and go with one that rocks!
